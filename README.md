Project Overview
The EcoStyle Marketplace is an online platform designed specifically for sellers of sustainable fashion, allowing them to easily register, manage, and showcase eco-friendly clothing, accessories and other eco-friendly things. With increasing consumer demand for sustainable and eco-conscious products, there is a growing need for a specialized platform that allows sellers to reach an audience interested in fashion that aligns with environmental values. This system solves the problem of fragmented marketplaces by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform where sellers can effectively list their products made from recyclable or environmentally friendly materials.
The system's primary goal is to create a digital space where sellers can seamlessly manage their product information, track inventory, and interact with their product listings, without the complexity of a traditional e-commerce platform. By focusing solely on sellers, this system enhances the ability of sustainable brands to grow their presence in the marketplace, empowering them to contribute to the global movement towards sustainable fashion.

Target Users:
The primary users of the EcoStyle Marketplace are sellers who specialize in sustainable fashion, looking to list their eco-friendly products in a dedicated online marketplace. These sellers are typically individuals or small businesses that prioritize environmentally conscious fashion choices, including products made from recyclable or renewable materials. The platform caters specifically to those who want to reach an audience interested in sustainable fashion, offering them an easy-to-use space to manage and showcase their products. While the platform does not include features for buyers, it is designed to meet the needs of sellers by providing streamlined registration, product listing, and inventory management tools. 
Measurable Outcomes:
